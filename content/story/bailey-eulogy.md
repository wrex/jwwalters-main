No matter the time or setting, Papa never failed to make an impression.
<!--more-->

He always managed
to be the most &mdash; the most clever, the most engaging, the most stubborn. As a
videographer he was ahead of his time. As a collector he was dedicated and thorough. As a
musician he was instinctual and comforting. And as a person he was knowledgeable,
playful, and larger than life.

He was a one of a kind person who will be remembered and who will be missed.
