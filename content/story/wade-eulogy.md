Oh, how he aggravated, frustrated, maddened, and incensed me. 

Adjectives describing him that come immediately to mind: 
<!--more-->


Irascible, stubborn, condescending, belittling, irritable, ridiculous,
controlling, incorrigible, insensitive, rude, prejudiced, inappropriate,
sedentary, bald, immense, eye roll worthy. 

Also:

Intelligent, knowledgeable, talented, loving, capable, industrious, funny,
clever, brilliant, lively, well meaning, generous, dependable, caring,
fatherly ... and larger than life. A force of nature.

As mad as he would make me, as quickly as he could get under my skin, I never
for a moment questioned his love for me, for his family. Never would it enter
my mind that he wasn’t there for me, that he wouldn’t give the shirt off his
back to protect and shelter me, to help me when and if I needed it. And he did,
often.

As much as I had anticipated Dad’s death over the last several months, as
prepared as I believed I was, I also knew that I couldn’t possibly know the
emotions I would feel when it happened.  The profound sense of loss that would
settle over me like falling snow. Not a sudden epiphany, but a slow realization
of what really would be missing from my life, from my senses, the weight of it
building up even now.

Some of my happiest memories of dad are family and friends gatherings when I
was a small kid, with him and others playing guitar and singing, food,
laughter, and games with the cousins. I think you could truly say he was the
life of the party, quite consistently. 

He also instilled in me a love of the outdoors, camping and hiking. From my
earliest memories of camping in the Catoctins with the Picketts, to the long
family hikes through stunning scenery in Adak, Alaska, and the truly
spectacular climb to the rim of Mt. Fuji. And the hilarious memory of him
hiring a horse to bring him DOWN the mountain! Last month while camping
together in the Shenandoah, Sam and I committed to climb Mt. Fuji together one
day, and now that gains more significance, to do it for dad. The childhood he
gave me is unparalleled, and I know how fortunate I am for such a gift.

And of course, to my great chagrin, he's left me with a love of country music,
despite my best efforts to resist. Dammit. That was subversive. That music
strongly evokes his presence, and I will never say a disparaging word about it
again.

I love you, dad, very much. And I miss you.
