    Weep Not for Me

    Weep not for me though I have gone
    Into that gentle night
    Grieve if you will, but not for long
    Upon my soul's sweet fight

    I am at peace, my soul's at rest
    There is no need for tears
    For with your love I was so blessed
    For all those many years

    There is no pain, I suffer not
    The fear is now all gone
    Put now these things out of your thougts
    In your memory I live on

    Remember not my fight for breath
    Remember not the strife
    Please do not dwell upon my death
    But celebrate my life
