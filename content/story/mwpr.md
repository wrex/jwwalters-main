Papa's last job before retiring at the ripe old age of 55 (!) was with the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firerarms.

At some point during his tenure he ordered a
custom made rubber stamp from someplace, and subsequently used it at every
opportunity, with every piece of correspondence that crossed his desk.

The stamp read:

> My warmest personal regards, <br />
> Jerry Walters

There is nothing like that personal touch!

I remember that when he retired, the people in his office made him a cake with "My
warmest personal regards" written across the top.
